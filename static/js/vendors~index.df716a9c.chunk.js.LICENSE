// Prevent newer renderers from RTE when used with older react package versions.

// Current owner and dispatcher used to share the same ref,

// but PR #14548 split them out to better support the react-debug-tools package.

// In DEV mode, we swap out invokeGuardedCallback for a special version

// that plays more nicely with the browser's DevTools. The idea is to preserve

// "Pause on exceptions" behavior. Because React wraps all user-provided

// functions in invokeGuardedCallback, and the production version of

// invokeGuardedCallback uses a try-catch, all user exceptions are treated

// like caught exceptions, and the DevTools won't pause unless the developer

// takes the extra step of enabling pause on caught exceptions. This is

// unintuitive, though, because even though React has caught the error, from

// the developer's perspective, the error is uncaught.

// To preserve the expected "Pause on exceptions" behavior, we don't use a

// try-catch in DEV. Instead, we synchronously dispatch a fake event to a fake

// DOM node, and call the user-provided callback from inside an event handler

// for that fake event. If the callback throws, the error is "captured" using

// a global event handler. But because the error happens in a different

// event loop context, it does not interrupt the normal program flow.

// Effectively, this gives us try-catch behavior without actually using

// try-catch. Neat!

// Check that the browser supports the APIs we need to implement our special

// DEV version of invokeGuardedCallback

// If document doesn't exist we know for sure we will crash in this method

// when we call document.createEvent(). However this can cause confusing

// errors: https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/3482

// So we preemptively throw with a better message instead.

// Keeps track of whether the user-provided callback threw an error. We

// set this to true at the beginning, then set it to false right after

// calling the function. If the function errors, `didError` will never be

// set to false. This strategy works even if the browser is flaky and

// fails to call our global error handler, because it doesn't rely on

// the error event at all.

// We immediately remove the callback from event listeners so that

// nested `invokeGuardedCallback` calls do not clash. Otherwise, a

// nested call would trigger the fake event handlers of any call higher

// in the stack.

// We check for window.hasOwnProperty('event') to prevent the

// window.event assignment in both IE <= 10 as they throw an error

// "Member not found" in strict mode, and in Firefox which does not

// support window.event.

// Create a global error event handler. We use this to capture the value

// that was thrown. It's possible that this error handler will fire more

// than once; for example, if non-React code also calls `dispatchEvent`

// and a handler for that event throws. We should be resilient to most of

// those cases. Even if our error event handler fires more than once, the

// last error event is always used. If the callback actually does error,

// we know that the last error event is the correct one, because it's not

// possible for anything else to have happened in between our callback

// erroring and the code that follows the `dispatchEvent` call below. If

// the callback doesn't error, but the error event was fired, we know to

// ignore it because `didError` will be false, as described above.

// Use this to track whether the error event is ever called.

// Ignore.

// Create a fake event type.

// Attach our event handlers

// Synchronously dispatch our fake event. If the user-provided function

// errors, it will trigger our global error handler.

/**
 * Summary of `DOMEventPluginSystem` event handling:
 *
 *  - Top-level delegation is used to trap most native browser events. This
 *    may only occur in the main thread and is the responsibility of
 *    ReactDOMEventListener, which is injected and can therefore support
 *    pluggable event sources. This is the only work that occurs in the main
 *    thread.
 *
 *  - We normalize and de-duplicate events to account for browser quirks. This
 *    may be done in the worker thread.
 *
 *  - Forward these native events (with the associated top-level type used to
 *    trap it) to `EventPluginRegistry`, which in turn will ask plugins if they want
 *    to extract any synthetic events.
 *
 *  - The `EventPluginRegistry` will then process each event by annotating them with
 *    "dispatches", a sequence of listeners and IDs that care about that event.
 *
 *  - The `EventPluginRegistry` then dispatches the events.

 * We listen for bubbled touch events on the document object.

// After this we'll use a set of heuristics to determine whether this

// render pass will run to completion or restart or "suspend" the commit.

// The actual logic for this is spread out in different places.

// This first principle is that if we're going to suspend when we complete

// a root, then we should also restart if we get an update or ping that

// might unsuspend it, and vice versa. The only reason to suspend is

// because you think you might want to restart before committing. However,

// it doesn't make sense to restart only while in the period we're suspended.

// Restarting too aggressively is also not good because it starves out any

// intermediate loading state. So we use heuristics to determine when.

// Suspense Heuristics

// If nothing threw a Promise or all the same fallbacks are already showing,

// then don't suspend/restart.

// If this is an initial render of a new tree of Suspense boundaries and

// those trigger a fallback, then don't suspend/restart. We want to ensure

// that we can show the initial loading state as quickly as possible.

// If we hit a "Delayed" case, such as when we'd switch from content back into

// a fallback, then we should always suspend/restart. SuspenseConfig applies to

// this case. If none is defined, JND is used instead.

// If we're already showing a fallback and it gets "retried", allowing us to show

// another level, but there's still an inner boundary that would show a fallback,

// then we suspend/restart for 500ms since the last time we showed a fallback

// anywhere in the tree. This effectively throttles progressive loading into a

// consistent train of commits. This also gives us an opportunity to restart to

// get to the completed state slightly earlier.

// If there's ambiguity due to batching it's resolved in preference of:

// 1) "delayed", 2) "initial render", 3) "retry".

// We want to ensure that a "busy" state doesn't get force committed. We want to

// ensure that new initial loading states can commit as soon as possible.

// This boundary already captured during this render. Continue to the next

// boundary.
